CIND 820 - Final Project
With this project I would like to make my own small contribution in the ongoing COVID pandemic fight. I believe that there is a need in the world for tools that can provide insights into the self-reported COVID19 vaccine side effects, especially as more different vaccines become available and they begin to interact with each other. The data is obtained by scraping Twitter.
